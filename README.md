# Update, Ads and Recommended Content blocker for LG TVs in The Netherlands

## FAQ

### What does it do?

When used by a pihole, or any other blocker, it blocks LG's annoying update notifications, toasts, popups, and recommended content section.
It also blocks the software update server in case LG comes up with some patch that allows them to bypass a DNS blocker.

### What doesn't it do?

It does not block ads on YouTube. It does not block content on Amazon Prime or Spotify.

### Sounds great, how do I use it?

- Open the list file within this repo.
- Select Raw on the top right.
- Copy the URL.
- Go to you DNS tool (PiHole or Adguard for example) and add the blocklist

When you turn it on again, it will fail to load the recommended tab, and just show you your apps.
